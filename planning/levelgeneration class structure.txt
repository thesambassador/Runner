Level generation classes:

Idea 1:

	Chunk class
		Adds itself to the stage, and has a removal function as well.
		Embedded tileset
		Public Tilemap groups:
			Main tilemap (with collidable tiles)
			Background tilemap (bushes, etc.)
			Foreground tilemap (grass, etc.)
	
	ChunkGen class
		Creates a new chunk
		Can be extended?
	
	Level class
		Has a LinkedList of Chunks
		Background image w/paralax 
		Decides when new chunks are generated and existing chunks are removed.
	
	Other thoughts...
		Should Chunk class be extended to make more different "themes"?  Should ChunkGen?
		Should ChunkGen just have a specific "theme" that can be changed out?
