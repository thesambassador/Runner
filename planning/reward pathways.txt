Reward pathways
	Places where the level splits into a harder short "path" that has more rewards than the standard path
First pass = generate level
	record history, mark X locations for potential reward pathways
	potential reward pathways:
		Any enemy/springboard that can launch you upwards
		Right before a drop in the Y position, jump on some floating platforms
		After a multi-level, jump from top level?
		During a larger gap, platforms below? maybe a cave?
		Rarely, just a normal split off from the level?
		
Second pass = generate reward pathways
	Types of reward pathways:
		Easy/short 
			Higher coins (have to jump on an enemy to reach)
			Single high platform with coins
			
		Medium/shortish
			In a gap, lower area with dissolving platform with coins on it
			Platforms (dissolving?) after a drop in Y
			Platforms (dissolving?) after a one-way platform
			In a gap, lower area with dissolving platforms into cave?
			
			Powerup at the end?
			
		Hard/longer (1 or less per level?)
			Start with a enemy/springboard up onto a high one-way platform
				Hard set of platforms (1-2 in width) onto an even harder set of platforms
			Start with a large gap, drop onto dissolving platforms of the same difficulty
			Powerup at the end?
			
Third pass = decorate
