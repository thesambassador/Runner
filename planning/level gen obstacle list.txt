Each chunk will be one of the "base units"
Each chunk has between 0 and... some number of obstacles
Each obstacle only appears between a mindifficulty and maxdifficulty
Obstacle types?
	Environment - solid parts that are part of the main tileset
		Does this include moving platforms?
	Hazard - moving or non-moving entity that kills on touch
	Enemy - different behaviors and ways to get around them
	

Base units:
	Flat
		Normal flat plain
		Bridge
		2-levels
	Gap
		Simple jump-over
		platforms in between
		Differnet under-you-things:
			Spikes
			Endless Pit
			Lava
	Elevation gain
		Normal jump (stairs)
		Elevator
		Jump-pad
	Gap+elevation gain?
		Moving platforms/elevators
		floating platform-steps
	Flat+elevation gain?
		2-levels, need to jump on 2nd level to get up
		
Obstacles:
	Flat:
		Enemies
			Normal jump-on (goombas)
			Jumping dudes (like flying jumping turtles)
			Attack-through (need to use attack)
			Slide-through (need to slide, then can jump on)
		Basic hurtles (2-high, just jump)
		Advanced hurtles (first is 2-high, next need to be jumped to)
		Pyramids
		Projectiles 
			From top/bottom
			From right-to-left
		Spinning flames (like in mario)
		Destructable blocks
		1-high, need to slide
	Gap:
		Enemies:
			Flying dudes (like the flying turtles)
			Projectiles (like bullet bill)
		Spaced out platforms
		Flying lava-fireballs
		Moving platforms
		Kill-lines (laser, lasts a few seconds, then goes away, need to time)
		Moving kill-you things (like the saws in SMB)
		Different-height platforms
		Disappearing platforms
		Falling platforms (donuts in Mario)
		Spinning platforms (randomly spin and knock you off, have to time your jumps)
		Rotating platforms (platforms "rotating" circularly around a pivot point)
	
	Elevation gain:
		Moving platforms
		Double-spring (jump on one, then need to hit another higher one)

	General obstacles:
		
Special events?
	Boss battles
	Projectiles
	Speed-requrement (running from something)
	Stand-on-platform and avoid obstacles (like mario lava levels, where you ride the platform)
	Falling challange?
	Spring challenge? (keep jumping on springs to get very high)
	

Difficulty:  function of currentX (how far to the right you've gone) and difficultyFactor.  To start, it'll be linear, with Difficulty = (int)(currentX / difficultyFactor), and difficultyFactor being ~1000

Difficulty changes:
	0(start): 
		Flat: obstacle limit = 1
			Flat length, no obstacles
			Simple hurtle
			Small pyramids
			Some 2-levels
		Gap: obstacle limit = 0
			Small width gaps (6 width max)
			Small gap with platform
		Elevation change:
			Basic, just go up or down 1 or 2 blocks only
	
	1:
		Flat: obstacle limit = 2
			Flat length, no obstacles
			Simple hurtle
			Small-large pyramids
			2-levels
			Normal enemy
			Destructable walls
		Gap: obstacle limit = 1
			Medium width gaps (8 width max)
			Spaced platforms (3 width between each), no height difference
		Elevation change:
			Basic, just go up or down 1 or 2 blocks only.
	2:
		Flat: obstacle limit = 2
			Flat length, no obstacles
			Simple hurtle
			Advanced hurtle
			2-levels
			Normal enemy
			Destructable walls
			Slide, width of 1
		Gap obstacle limit = 1
			Medium width gaps (8 width max)
			Spaced platforms (4 widht between each max), small height difference
			Flying enemies
		Elevation change:
			Basic, just go up or down 1 or 2 blocks
			Springboard (6-8 height)
	4: 
		Flat: obstacle limit = 3
			Flat length, no obstacles
			Simple Hurtle
			Advanced hurtle
			2-levels
			Normal enemy
			Destructable walls
			Slide, width of 2
			Jumping enemy
		Gap: obstacle limit = 2
			Medium width gaps (8 width max)
			Spaced platforms (4 width between each max), max height difference (as high as you can jump)
			Flying enemies
			Falling platforms (donuts)
		Elevation change:
			Basic, just go up or down 1 or 2 blocks
			Springboard (6-8 height)
			Elevator (1-2 moving platforms, 6-8 height)
		Gap/Elevation change:
			3 platforms, going up like stairs, 2 height each change
